Notes for how to work on R projects

## Software you will need
Ideally, you will install these in order, as each step expects the last to have been done, to some extent.

### Github

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a code respository that provides some project management tools and allows you to host your code in a shareable way.

More details on how GitHub works and how to use it with R and Rstudio look [here: https://happygitwithr.com/index.html](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html)

We will generally follow the advice of this guide when setting up a new project that involves R code or when someone new needs to run and/or modify the code.  The point of this is to allow us to capture any changes and especially additions to the code back into our Oranizations code repository for the project.  It also has the advantage of allowing us to fork versions of the code for other projects.

#### Gitshell and Git for windows
Get git for windows by downloading [here:  https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/)

* This will allow you to 
  * set up version control for any documents, 
  * set up new R projects from GitHub respositories, and 
  * easily push your code up to our Organization on GitHub

* Run the installer

### R
R installers and updaters can be downloaded from here:  [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

* Click on 'Download R for Windows' link
* Click on 'base' link for basic R
* Click 'Download R-X.Y.Z for Windows' (where X.Y.Z is the latest stable version) and begin the installer download
* Run the installer before you download and install Rstudio

### Rstudio
Rstudio is now owned and developed by ***Posit.co***
[https://posit.co/](https://posit.co/)

* Click the download link in the upper right corner (?)
* You want Rstudio for Desktop
* Since you already downloaded R, you just need to click 'DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP FOR WINDOWS'
